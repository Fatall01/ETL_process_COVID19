# ETL_process_COVID19

In this Jupyter notebook, I builded a data science/engineering project that is aiming to extract biological data from different sources with different techniques. The extracted data was transformed (cleaning) using pandas and loaded into MySQL. A schema was created to connect the data.

## 1. Data extraction from:

### ChEMBL Data Web Services
Overview of covid-19 data
Target data
Activity data
Assay data

### UniProt
Retrieve ID/mapping service: from ChEMBL to UniProtKB
Download xlsx file

## 2. Data transformation
Data cleaning
Dropping columns
Renaming columns
Dealing with missing values
Remove the duplicated data

## 3. Connecting python to MySQL and data loading
Use SQLAlchemy to connect python to MySQl
Create a MySQL Schema
